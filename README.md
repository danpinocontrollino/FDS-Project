# FDS Project – Deep Learning for Daily Mental Wellness

This repository contains the code for our **Foundations of Data Science** final project.

We use the **Work-Life Balance Synthetic Daily Wellness Dataset** (Kaggle) to predict
daily mental wellness indicators of workers from their work–life patterns and
recent history, using deep learning models (LSTM and Transformer).

**🎯 Key Achievement:** 98.5% accuracy on job satisfaction prediction (vs 89.3% baseline)

> 📊 **Research Context:** Our results align with state-of-the-art synthetic data studies (94-99% accuracy) and represent a theoretical upper bound compared to real-world wearable studies (70-82%). See [External Benchmarks & Related Work](docs/EXTERNAL_BENCHMARKS.md) for detailed comparison with clinical and ML research.

## 1. Project Overview

**Goal.**

Given daily information about workers (sleep, working hours, breaks, exercise,
screen time, etc.), we want to:

1. **Predict daily mental wellness scores** (e.g., stress, mood, burnout risk)
   from the features of a single day (tabular ML).
2. **Use time series models (LSTM/GRU)** to predict the wellness of tomorrow
   from the last *N* days of behaviour.
3. Optionally, learn a compact representation of behaviour patterns with an
   **autoencoder** and explore clusters of worker profiles.

We treat this as a **deep learning project on tabular + time-series data**, with
classical ML baselines for comparison.

## 2. Dataset

We use the Kaggle dataset:

> **Work-Life Balance Synthetic Daily Wellness Dataset**  
> by Wafaa El-Husseini  
> https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/wafaaelhusseini/worklife-balance-synthetic-daily-wellness-dataset

The dataset is **synthetic**, which avoids privacy issues but preserves realistic
relationships between work habits and wellness indicators.

We do **not** store the CSV files in this repository.  
Instead, each collaborator downloads the data locally using the Kaggle API
(see below).
